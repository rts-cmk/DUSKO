            	<p>It all started with the drive to create
something bigger & better than what was
already out there. Hours of drawing,
thinking, re-thinking, iterating, and
finally creating, all to result in a
lifestyle brand with some serious bite.
DUSKO isn’t just polite t’shirts and
socks, it’s a collection of everyday
details that give you that kick of
inspiration, the drive to keep going,
get s*** done.</p>
